## Modal Logic S4.2

S4.2 is a modal logic that extends S4 with the Geach axiom. The key features include:

### Axioms
- **K**: â–¡(A â‡’ B) â‡’ (â–¡A â‡’ â–¡B)
- **T**: â–¡A â‡’ A (reflexivity)
- **4**: â–¡A â‡’ â–¡â–¡A (transitivity) - *Note: Not derivable in this labelled system*
- **D**: â–¡A â‡’ â™¢A (seriality)
- **Geach**: â™¢â–¡A â‡’ â–¡â™¢A

### Inference Rules
- **Necessitation**: If âŠ¢ A then âŠ¢ â–¡A
- **Modus Ponens**: From âŠ¢ A and âŠ¢ A â‡’ B infer âŠ¢ B

## Technical Details

### Position Labels
The system uses subset positions to track modal contexts. Each formula is labeled with a position from `Subset n` where `n` is the number of available tokens.

### Cut Elimination
The cut elimination proof follows the standard approach:
1. Define a complexity measure (Î´-rank) for proofs
2. Show that cut-free proofs have rank 0
3. Implement a mix lemma to eliminate cuts
4. Prove termination of the elimination process

### Semantic Model
The semantics uses bounded join semilattices as the underlying structure for Kripke frames, providing a natural interpretation of the modal operators.

## Usage

This code requires Agda with the standard library. The main theorems and constructions can be found in:

- `cutElimination`: The main cut elimination function
- `axiomK`, `axiomT`, `axiomD`, `geachAxiom`: Derivations of key modal axioms
- `Soundness`: Semantic soundness theorem (statement)

## Implementation Status

- âœ… Complete syntax and inference rules
- âœ… Cut elimination algorithm structure
- âœ… Basic semantic framework
- ðŸ”„ Several proof holes remain to be filled (marked with `{! !}`)
- ðŸ”„ Full soundness proof incomplete

The formalization demonstrates the key concepts of modal logic S4.2 and provides a foundation for further development of modal proof theory in Agda.
